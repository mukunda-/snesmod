## snesmod

An audio library for the Super Nintendo. It supports Impulse Tracker music and sound
effect streaming from SNES to SPC (games like Star Ocean do that).

See doc/snesmod_music.txt for rules and restrictions when composing music. The SPC driver
only supports a subset of Impulse Tracker features.
